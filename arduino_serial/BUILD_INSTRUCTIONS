Make sure ROS Kinetic is installed and PATH variables are set; this will be true if "roscore" begins a process.
Make sure ros_serial and rosserial_arduino is installed for Kinetic.
Make sure a serial port is open and connected to an arduino board, easy way to check this is using Arduino IDE; you may need to grant permission with: chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0 if your arduino is connected on ttyACM0. You can check this by trying to upload an example program on the Arduino; the IDE console will say Upload Successful.
