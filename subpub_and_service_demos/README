Make sure ROS Kinetic is installed and PATH variables are set; this will be true if "roscore" begins a process.

Scroll down to Appendix A if this is your first time.

talker.cpp and listener.cpp implement a talker which publishes the value of a counter and listener.cpp subscribes to the counter and outputs it using ROS stream.

add_two_ints implements a server which awaits for requests then returns the results

A brief intro to ROS; please see documentation on ROS wiki for details.

0. ROS executables
roscore - executes main thread
rostopic - returns information about a ros topic
rosrun - executes a thread
rqt_graph - visualises node structure
an important command is source ./devel/setup.bash when applicable. puts ROS executables of current workspace onto the PATH of your terminal

1. Publishers and Subscribers
Roscore = Newstand
Publisher = A media outlet
Subscriber = Listener

2. Messages and Services
Server - implements service, waits for client to send request
Client - sends requests to a server
Messages - message_generation is a ROS package which facilitates auto-generation of relevant .h, .cpp, and .py for custom ROS message support
Service -
